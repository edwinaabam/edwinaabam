I’m a data-focused problem solver with a strong interest in applied data science and machine learning, particularly projects that move beyond analysis into real, usable systems.

I enjoy working across the full journey of a project — from understanding data and exploring patterns, through modelling and evaluation, to building simple interfaces that allow others to interact with the results.

## 🌱 What I’m currently working on

- End-to-end data science and machine learning projects  
- Turning trained models into usable applications (inference, APIs, simple UIs)  
- Strengthening my understanding of how models are used in practice, not just built

## 📂 Featured Project

### 🥖 Perishable Goods Demand & Waste Prediction  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, FastAPI, Streamlit  

An end-to-end project focused on predicting unit sales for perishable retail goods. The project includes:
- exploratory data analysis and feature preparation  
- training and saving predictive models  
- a FastAPI backend for model inference  
- a Streamlit interface for user interaction
